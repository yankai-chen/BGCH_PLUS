## Towards Effective Top-N Hamming Search via Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing

![替代文本](Framework.jpg)

This repository provides the PyTorch implementation for our TKDE'24 paper [[BGCH+](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09239)].


## 🔧 Requirements

The codes are built with the following main dependencies:


* `pytorch=1.8.1`
* `pandas`
* `scipy`
* `numpy`
* `tensorboardX`
* `scikit-learn`
* `tqdm`
* `pybind11`
* `cppimport`



## 🚀 Usage

To training/evaluating our model, please execute the command of the specific dataset, as shown in sota_settings.py
